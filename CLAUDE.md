# Crownguard — notes for Claude sessions

A pixel-art tower defense (React + Canvas, Vite). `npm run dev` serves it at
http://localhost:5173; pushing `main` deploys it to
https://philipwilliams1229.github.io/CrownGuard/ (GitHub Pages, ~1 minute).

## Read first

- **`art/STYLE-GUIDE.md`** — the art direction and every rule for new art:
  pixel style, palette, proportions, camera, tower footprints, where each
  kind of art lives, fonts, performance, and the lab pages for checking work.
- `art/DESIGN-BRIEF.md` / `art/GEMINI-PROMPTS.md` — sprite sizes and prompts
  if AI-painted images are ever used.

## Keep the guides current

When a session changes how things are made — art rules, balance levers,
tools, file layout, or a lesson learned the hard way — update the matching
guide (`art/STYLE-GUIDE.md`, this file) in the same commit. The next session
should never have to rediscover it.

## Balance and testing

- `node scripts/sim.mjs --level <id> --endure` — castle damage per wave for
  a campaign level (both army doctrines); `--all`, `--ledger`, `--perf`.
- `node scripts/marathon.mjs --realm thornbrook --to 160 --endure` — a long
  Endless run with all 13 halls and all 52 final forms; reports engine
  errors, per-form damage and income.
- Levers: the crowd (`crowd`, `CROWD_WEIGHT`, `overlap` in
  `src/data/waves.js`), `SPLASH_CAP` in `src/engine/update.js`, bounty cap and
  wave bonus, per-level gold in `src/data/campaign.js`, tower stats in
  `src/data/towers.js`, castle works and endless ranks in `src/data/castle.js`.
- The owner playtests; the sims are a floor, not a target.
